# CSUSM-CS-111-Labs-Python
These projects were made using Python to help me learn the Python programming language. The lab instructions were used from what
I have been taught in the introductory course, Computer Science 111 at California State University San Marcos, using C++.
These programs are beginner level and only completed using the format of the lab instruction.
